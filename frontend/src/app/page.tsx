/*
 * Home route — 02-INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md §2.1, 06-COMPONENT-SPEC.md §10.6.
 * One fetch, in this Server Component, through the typed getHome() helper
 * (CLAUDE.md rule 1). Static + ISR on the `home` tag / 86400s window, configured
 * in the fetch layer.
 *
 * The page is composition only. 04-API-CONTRACT §5 defines HomeResponse as
 * `{ _global, seo, blocks[] }` — the whole body is `blocks[]`, with no separate
 * hero/featured/events fields — so every home section (hero, featured_items,
 * events_preview, text, cta_band, …) is a PageBlock rendered in editor order by
 * the shared PageBlockRenderer. Nothing here is home-specific: the Hero,
 * FeaturedMenuRow, and EventsPreview block components already exist and are
 * reused as-is.
 *
 * Heading outline: unlike the other routes, Home has no PageHeader — the primary
 * Hero (the first block) owns the site's <h1> (PageBlockRenderer passes
 * `isPrimary` to the index-0 hero; a later hero would be an <h2>). Every other
 * block's top heading is an <h2> via `headingLevelOffset={0}`, so the outline
 * runs h1 → h2 with no skipped level.
 *
 * Empty/partial states are the block components' own contract: FeaturedMenuRow
 * and EventsPreview return null on an empty array, an omitted block simply does
 * not render, and PageBlockRenderer renders nothing for an unknown type rather
 * than throwing. The route makes no assumption about which blocks are present.
 *
 * generateMetadata / JSON-LD is the SEO task; this slice renders the page body.
